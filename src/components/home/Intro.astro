        Our entire infrastructure is EU-GMP compliant, and we have already
        undergone a pre-audit by a specialized EU-GMP firm. While we finalize
        our own EU-GMP certification, we currently supply EU-GMP compliant
        flowers, processed in a facility that meets all regulatory standards as
        non certified flowers.
