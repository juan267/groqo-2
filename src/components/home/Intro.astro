              Our entire infrastructure is EU-GMP compliant, and we have already
              undergone a pre-audit by a specialized EU-GMP firm. While we
              finalize our own EU-GMP certification, we currently supply EU-GMP
              compliant flowers, processed in a facility that meets all
              regulatory standards as non certified flowers.
